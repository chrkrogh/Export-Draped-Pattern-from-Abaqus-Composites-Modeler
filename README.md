# Export-Draped-Pattern-from-Abaqus-Composites-Modeler
This repository contains the supporting files to the guide "How to Export the Draped Pattern from Abaqus Composites Modeler". 
It was created by Christian Krogh, Department of Materials and Production, Aalborg University, Denmark.

The files in the repository are:
- BladeLikeMold_mdb.py (python script for generating and exporting the draped patterns in Abaqus Composites Modeler).
- BladeLikeMold.sat (mold geometry used by "BladeLikeMold_mdb.py").
- ReadAbaqusDrapedPatternVFP.m (MATLAB script for reading and plotting the exported draped pattern data).

The three .vfp files exported by Abaqus Composites Modeler when running the script "BladeLikeMold_mdb.py" can be found in the folder Output files.
